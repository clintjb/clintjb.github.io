I've been keeping an eye on these for a while. Basically [Josh Emrich](https://dribbble.com/emrichoffice) was commissioned to illustrate some characters for a new game called "Campy Creatures". I was never a great lover of tactical card games - but the 60s inspired artwork for this one is just too good not to share.
