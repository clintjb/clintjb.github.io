There's a subreddit called [Reddit Gets Drawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/) where people can upload their photos, and the community has a go at recreating them. So last week I was a little curious and linked up an old picture of my daughter and I to see what would happen. 

The final picture is a pen & paper drawing by [sanjayatpilcrow](https://www.reddit.com/user/sanjayatpilcrow) that I'm super impressed by. It's amazing a whole community has been created based on a common love of creating and at the same time making random strangers incredibly happy. The community offers constructive feedback to each other and I genuinely believe its one of the best examples of positivity on the internet.

Here are some of my favorite pieces over the past few months (and of course mine as well!)

Cheers,
