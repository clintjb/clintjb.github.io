So anyway this was originally some work done from an illustrator named [Helen Green](http://dollychops.tumblr.com/).

In honour of Bowie's birthday she put together a series of illustrations from all his persona's over the years - well someone decided to "one-up" it by adding Steve Buscemi to the mix. 

I've got to admit, seeing as I'm a fan of both of them I really quite enjoyed the randomness of this. 

Cheers
