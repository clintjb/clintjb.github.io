The below recipes are basically interchangeable for either sourdough or cornbread biscuits - both are fantastic and I love to whip a batch up if I'm putting on a big BBQ spread.

Cornbread
* 125gm Sliced Bacon (Cut Into ¼-inch Strips) 
* 1 Bunch Spring Onion Trimmed And Cut
* 1/2 Cups Flour
* 1/2 Cups Cornmeal
* 1/2 Tablespoon Baking Powder
* 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
* 1/2 Cups Cheddar Cheese
* 3/4 Cups Buttermilk
* 2 Eggs
* 1/4 Cups Melted Butter

Sourdough
* 3/4 Cups Buttermilk 
* 4 Tablespoons Butter 
* 1 Cups Flour 
* 1/2 Teaspoon Sugar 
* 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder 
* 1/2 Teaspoon Salt 
* 1/2 Cups Cheddar Cheese
* 1/4 Cups Bunch Spring Onion Trimmed And Cut

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 200 degrees  

Cook the bacon in the skillet over medium heat until it starts to sizzle. Regulate the heat so that it cooks slowly and evenly, stirring occasionally. Once the bacon has started to color, stir in the scallions and continue to cook until the bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes longer. 

As soon as you start cooking the bacon, combine all the dry ingredients and cheese in a medium bowl and stir well to mix. In a 2-cup measuring cup, whisk the milk and eggs together and set near the bowl. 

Once the bacon is ready, add the egg mixture and melted butter to the dry ingredients. Pour the contents into the skillet and use a large rubber spatula to mix the batter smooth. 

Set the empty skillet over medium heat (it doesn’t matter if a few pieces of bacon and scallion have remained behind) and let it heat for a minute. Pour in the batter and bake the cornbread until it is risen and firm, about 15 minutes. 

Cool on a rack for 5 minutes and serve while still warm, cut into wedges.
