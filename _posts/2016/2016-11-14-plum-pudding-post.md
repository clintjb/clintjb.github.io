This was my Mums recipe that I grew up with as a kid. As a child, I remember our whole laundry smelling of plum pudding while it was hanging during December. This smell still to this day, takes me back.... I can only recommend this as a brilliant finish to any traditional Christmas dinner.

* 1kg mixed dry fruit
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 300ml carton cream
* 2 1/4 cups plain flour
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon bicarb soda
* 1 cup port
* 70cm x 70cm calico cloth OR 2.5l steamed pudding mold

Firstly its good to note this recipe can be used for a traditional cloth or mold method. Just adjust the steps accordingly.

Boil the cloth for 30mins and than wring it out well to ensure the cloth is clean and dry.

Chop the fruit into small parts and place into a bowl. In a separate (Large!) bowl, beat the sugar and eggs until they are thick and creamy.

Add the fruit, cream and port to the egg mixture and mix well. Add all the dry ingredients and mix until no lumps exist and the batter is consistent.

* Sprinkle 1/2 a cup of additional flour over the centre of the cloth. Place the batter mix into the centre of cloth. Pull all the corners tightly and shape into a ball and tie off at the top tightly. (leave c.a. 2.5cms space between the batter and the knot as the pudding will expand)

or

* Lightly butter the pudding mold and sprinkle a little flour inside. Pour the batter inside the mold and sprinkle a little more flour at the end. Place a piece of fabric over the base and then secure the lid.

Bring a pot of water to the boil and float the pudding off the bottom of the pot for 5 hours. Once finished hang or sit the pudding in a cold dry spot for anywhere between 1-3 months.

On the day of serving, boil it again for 1.5 hours and serve! I highly recommend with brandy custard!
