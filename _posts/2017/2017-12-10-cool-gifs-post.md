Here's some cool little animations I've come across over the course of this year - most of them were likely found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). Also be sure to check out the recently created "part 2" of this, focussed predominantly on comic based gifs which you can find [here](https://clintbird.com/blog/cool-gifs-comic-post).
