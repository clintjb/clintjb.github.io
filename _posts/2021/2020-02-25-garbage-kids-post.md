As kids, my brother and I never had particularly much spending money and my parents were both quite thrifty. One of the absolute highlights for me was around once every couple of months or so we were allowed to head down to the local milkbar and grab a pack of Garbage Pail Kids stickers. 

Just writing this - I can even smell that disgustingly brittle chewing gum that came in the wax pack. My brother and I would wet ourselves laughing all the way home at the ridiculous artwork - I'm not certain who the artist was that's recreated these, but as soon as I saw them they instantly put a smile on my face.
