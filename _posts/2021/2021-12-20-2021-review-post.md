So no need to go on too much about this, its second year in a row now our team Christmas plans have been canceled / postponed so decided to continue with a new tradition ([last years here](https://clintbird.com/blog/2020-review-post)) by reflecting again with a small webpage to celebrate the challenges and achievements of the year. 

Same as last year, it was thrown together while watching football (EPL really is great during December!) so it's not optimized for handheld devices - best to check it out on a laptop. Again though what an enormous year filled with great projects, learnings, ups / downs & plenty of delivered value.

I must admit with the amount of variability and topics running over our team it's easy to forget where we've come from. I really have enjoyed taking the time to reflect on the year and here's a highlight on just a few of the things we've managed to achieve!
