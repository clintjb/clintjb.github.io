Well, here we are again - fifth year in a row ([last years here](https://clintbird.com/blog/2023-review-post)) of keeping up with this little tradition of reflecting on the team’s journey over the year. By now, it’s a staple of my December routine: pour a drink, put on some football, and throw together a quick and dirty wrap-up of our year.

2024 was a year where we saw the team hit new heights — more refinement, maturity, and focus than ever before. It’s been a pleasure watching how we’ve grown, adapted, and continued to deliver value, even through the inevitable challenges that cropped up. This year’s review is a celebration of that progress while acknowledging that the journey is far from over.

As always, this one’s best viewed on a laptop or monitor (mobile optimization still isn’t part of this tradition, it seems). Here’s to another year of achievements, learnings, and looking forward to what’s next.
