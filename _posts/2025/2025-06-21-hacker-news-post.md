_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Saturday 04 October 2025_

Well, here we are again—another dive into something that’s caught my eye and kept me up late tinkering. This time, it’s all about Niri, a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor that’s been making waves in the Linux community. And honestly, it’s been a while since something made me this excited about window management.

You know how it is—some days you’re just scrolling through GitHub, and you stumble across a project that feels like it was built exactly for you. That’s Niri for me. It’s fresh, it’s clever, and it’s built from the ground up with this beautifully pragmatic approach to tiling. No resizing wars, no windows spilling over where they shouldn’t—just smooth, infinite columns that play nicely across multiple monitors. It’s the kind of thoughtful design that makes you wonder why nobody thought of it sooner.

What really stands out is how Niri handles workspaces. They’re dynamic, vertical, and each monitor gets its own set. It’s one of those details that sounds small but changes everything when you’re deep in flow. And the fact that it preserves workspace layout across monitor disconnects? Genius. It’s the kind of polish that tells you the developer isn’t just building features—they’re building an experience.

I’ve always been a sucker for tools that embrace continuous improvement, and Niri is no exception. Live-reloading config, gradient borders with Oklab support, custom shaders for animations—it’s clear that a lot of love (and a solid dose of Rust) went into this. And the fact that it plays nicely with screen readers and supports tablets and touchpads? That’s not just functional—it’s inclusive.

But here’s the thing: Niri isn’t trying to be everything to everyone. It’s not a full desktop environment, and I kind of love that. It leaves room for your waybars, your fuzzels, your own personal touch. It’s a compositor that knows what it is and does it brilliantly.

Performance-wise, it’s surprisingly lightweight. I’ve seen folks running it on some seriously old hardware, and it just works. And with fractional scaling support and pixel-perfect UI? It’s clear that attention to detail runs deep here.

If you’re someone who loves to optimize workflows, who gets a kick out of elegant solutions to complex problems, give Niri a shot. It’s stable, it’s thoughtful, and it’s one of those projects that reminds you why open source is so damn cool.

Sometimes the best ideas are the ones that feel obvious in hindsight. Niri is one of those. Here’s to more late nights tweaking configs and falling in love with good software. 🍻
