# Why GOG’s Homecoming Feels Like a Win for Gamers Like Us  

Let me tell you about the first time I dusted off my old *Gothic II* discs, fired up GOG, and realized I didn’t have to fiddle with compatibility patches or jump through DRM hoops just to relive those foggy, griffin-filled afternoons. That moment—pure gaming freedom—is exactly why today’s news feels personal.  

**Michał Kiciński, the original co-founder of GOG**, is stepping back in to take the reins. If you’ve ever wondered whether corporate suits understand why we cling to classics while eyeing new indies with retro souls, this move might just settle the debate.  

GOG has always been that unapologetically principled friend who refuses to compromise—DRM-free or bust, offline installers lovingly preserved, no asterisks hidden in the fine print. In a world where launchers multiply like gremlins and subscriptions dangle games like carrots on sticks, that philosophy isn’t just refreshing—it’s radical.  

### So what’s next?  

1. **DRM-free isn’t going anywhere.** If anything, it’s doubling down as GOG’s core DNA. Your library stays yours, untouched, untethered. No sudden license revocations, no “oops, we sunsetted this.”  
2. **Preservation gets a shot in the arm.** Those Patron donations and tip-jar funds? Still fueling rescue missions for abandoned gems. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve watched GOG resurrect a game I assumed was lost to licensing purgatory.  
3. **Independence, but not isolation.** CD PROJEKT RED games aren’t ghosting us—*Cyberpunk 2077*’s neon glow and *The Witcher*’s grimy taverns will still find a home here. But crucially, GOG gets to keep its soul while CD PROJEKT focuses on doing what they do best: crafting RPGs that eat our weekends.  

Here’s the thing: platforms come and go, but **games are stories**. They’re playgrounds, time capsules, conversation starters. When Michał talks about “freedom, independence, and genuine control,” it’s not corporate jargon—it’s a vow to keep those stories alive. Not as museum pieces, but as living, playable slices of culture.  

### The quiet rebellion continues  

GOG’s mission—*Make Games Live Forever*—isn’t glamorous. Restoring compatibility layers, untangling rights, rebuilding lost builds? It’s digital archaeology with none of the Indiana Jones fanfare. But every time I boot up a 20-year-old game without a 20-step troubleshooting guide, I’m reminded why it matters.  

So here’s to Michał, the team, and everyone who’s ever clicked “install” on a GOG classic. This isn’t just a business move; it’s a homecoming for a vision that’s always felt *ours*. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a date with *Arcanum*—no clients, no logins, just pure, unfiltered nostalgia.  

**What’s the first classic you’d resurrect given the chance?** Drop me a line—let’s swap war stories. 🕹️
