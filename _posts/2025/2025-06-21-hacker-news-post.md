_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Saturday 13 September 2025_

It’s funny how things come full circle sometimes. A couple of years back, when I first started digging into the energy debate—fueled by late-night reading and probably one too many cups of coffee—I never imagined how quickly the conversation would shift. Back then, talking about nuclear energy in certain circles felt like bringing a steak to a vegan potluck. Awkward, to say the least.

But here we are. Just the other day, a ruling came down from the EU’s highest court that, to me, feels like common sense finally getting its day in the sun. They’ve affirmed it: nuclear energy is clean energy. Not just sort-of-clean, not “clean under certain conditions,” but legitimately, scientifically clean. Worthy of green finance, worthy of being part of the solution.

I remember when opposition to nuclear felt like a given. Countries turning their backs on it, activists shouting it down, headlines warning of doom. And look where we are now. Germany’s rethinking. The Netherlands, Belgium—they’ve moved on. Even some of the staunchest anti-nuclear voices have quieted, or in some cases, changed their tune entirely.

What’s changed? The science, really. It was always there, but sometimes it takes a while for evidence to cut through the noise. The lifecycle impact of nuclear is staggeringly low. The safety record? Among the best in the energy world. It’s not perfect—nothing is—but when you stack it up against what we’re up against with climate change, it’s not even a close call.

And yet, there are still holdouts. Some groups dig their heels in, refusing to budge even when the courts, the data, and the reality on the ground are telling a different story. It’s frustrating, honestly. We’re in a race—a real one—to decarbonize, to give people everywhere access to clean, reliable power, and we’re wasting time debating something that should be a no-brainer.

This ruling isn’t just about policy or finance. It’s a signal. It tells investors it’s okay to put money into nuclear. It tells innovators it’s worth their time. It tells the world that we’re serious about using every tool we have.

But the work isn’t done. Not even close. There are still countries with outdated bans on the books, still funding gaps, still political battles to fight. And beyond Europe, the need is even greater—places where energy poverty is real, where Russia’s influence looms large, where the choice isn’t between nuclear and solar, but between power and darkness.

We’ve made progress, no doubt. We’ve helped shift the conversation, defended science, opened doors. But it’s on us—all of us who care about this stuff—to keep pushing. To make sure that in five years, we’re not still having the same arguments while the thermometer climbs and the glaciers melt.

Here’s to the win, but here’s to the work ahead, too. Onward.
