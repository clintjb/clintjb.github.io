_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Friday 22 August 2025_

**AI Won’t Steal Junior Jobs—It’ll Make Them More Human**  

Let me start with a confession: I’ve never been a fan of the "AI will replace us all" doomsday chatter. Sure, I love geeking out over the latest LLM breakthroughs or automating the hell out of my BBQ temperature logs with Python scripts. But the idea that we’d use AI to phase out entry-level roles? That’s not just shortsighted—it’s *lazy leadership*.  

Here’s why.  

Somewhere along the way, we convinced ourselves that junior staff are just cheap labor for grunt work. Spreadsheets, data entry, drafting emails—tasks we’re now gleefully offloading to bots. But that misses the point entirely. Those early roles? They’re where people *learn*. Where they absorb the rhythm of a business, the unwritten rules, the art of solving messy real-world problems. You don’t automate apprenticeship. You *invest* in it.  

Take it from someone who’s spent years in tech and ops: the best teams I’ve built weren’t stacked with senior hires. They were *grown*. Fresh perspectives paired with seasoned experience. A junior dev who questions why we’ve always done something a certain way. A new grad spotting inefficiencies in a process we’d all glossed over. That’s the magic AI can’t replicate—*curiosity*.  

And let’s talk about the human side. My son’s just getting into coding (Fortnite stats dashboards count, right?), and the thrill on his face when his script finally runs? That’s the spark we’d extinguish if we gatekept entry points behind AI gatekeepers. Growth isn’t just about output; it’s about *ownership*. About letting people stumble, debug, and—yes—waste a few hours on a solution that already exists… because that’s how they’ll invent the next one that doesn’t.  

So here’s my take: AI should *elevate* junior roles, not erase them. Automate the tedious bits? Absolutely. Free up mental space for creativity, mentorship, and strategic thinking? *Hell yes.* But if your big innovation is replacing interns with chatbots, you’re not cutting-edge—you’re just cutting corners.  

The future of work isn’t fewer humans. It’s *smarter humans*. And that starts with giving the next generation the tools, the trust, and the room to grow.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a GitHub repo to debug with a 12-year-old. (Wish me patience.) 🍻
