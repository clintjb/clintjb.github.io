_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Wednesday 01 October 2025_

You know, I’ve always been fascinated by how we consume information—especially news. It’s one of those things we do almost automatically, scrolling endlessly, bouncing from one headline to the next, hoping something sticks. But lately, I’ve been asking myself: is this really how it should be? Should staying informed feel like a chore, or worse, leave you feeling drained and anxious?

I’ve spent years tinkering with workflows, optimizing processes, and applying lean principles to everything from data pipelines to BBQ recipes. And honestly, the way most of us engage with news feels… broken. It’s noisy, it’s manipulative, and it rarely leaves you feeling smarter or more grounded. So when I started thinking about what a better version might look like, a few core ideas kept coming to mind.

First, signal over noise. There’s something powerful about cutting through the clutter and getting to what actually matters. Not what’s designed to trigger a reaction or keep you scrolling, but what helps you understand the world a little better. That means hearing from diverse sources, not just the ones that confirm what you already believe. It’s about widening the aperture, not narrowing it.

Then there’s the rhythm of it. I’ve always believed that good rituals make life richer—whether it’s my yearly team reflections with a quiet drink or the deliberate way I approach a slow-cooked chili. Why shouldn’t news be the same? One thoughtful update per day, something you can actually finish, something contained. No endless notifications, no FOMO. Just clarity, and then the freedom to move on.

And privacy—well, that’s non-negotiable. Your attention shouldn’t be someone else’s product. You should be able to read, learn, and reflect without being tracked, profiled, or sold to. It’s a simple idea, but one that’s become radical in today’s attention economy.

I love that this approach is community-driven, too. Open source, open to suggestions, open to improvement. It feels like the digital equivalent of a well-tended garden—something built together, something that grows and adapts. Not a walled garden where everything is decided for you.

At the end of the day, it’s not about reinventing the wheel. It’s about returning to what news was supposed to be: a tool for understanding, not a trap for your attention. A brief, reliable companion in your day—not a source of stress.

Maybe I’m just an optimist, but I really believe we can do better. And sometimes, doing better starts with questioning the defaults we’ve all accepted for too long.

Here’s to news that actually leaves you informed—and maybe even a little inspired.
