_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Sunday 31 August 2025_

When you’re building something—anything, really—it’s tempting to chase perfection right out of the gate. You want the elegant solution, the scalable architecture, the thing that looks impressive on a whiteboard. I get it. I’ve been there. But over the years, I’ve come to believe that the real art isn’t in building for the future you imagine—it’s in building for the reality you have.

Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.

It sounds almost too straightforward, doesn’t it? Like something you’d tell a junior developer on their first day. But here’s the thing: simplicity isn’t easy. It’s not about cutting corners or being lazy. It’s about understanding the problem so deeply that the solution becomes obvious—and often, underwhelmingly simple.

I remember working on a project a while back where we needed to add some basic user analytics. The team immediately started sketching out data pipelines, event tracking systems, real-time dashboards. It was exciting stuff. But then we paused and asked: what’s the simplest thing that could possibly work here?

Turns out, a couple of log files and a cron job were all we really needed at that stage. Not glamorous. Not “scalable” in the way people love to talk about. But it worked. And more importantly, it gave us time to understand what we actually needed before investing in complexity.

There’s a kind of beauty in systems that just… work. They don’t draw attention to themselves. They don’t require endless meetings to explain or maintain. They’re like well-oiled machines—quiet, reliable, almost boring. And that’s exactly the point.

I think a lot of us fall into the trap of equating complexity with competence. We want to prove we know the latest tools, the hottest frameworks, the most distributed architectures. But real mastery often looks like doing less, not more. It’s knowing when to say, “We don’t need that yet.” Or better still: “We may never need that.”

This isn’t just a technical philosophy—it’s something I try to apply everywhere. In my BBQ experiments (yes, really), in how I structure my team’s workflow, even in how I approach learning something new. Start simple. Understand the basics. Add complexity only when it’s demanded, not because you’re afraid of what might happen if you don’t.

Of course, there are always objections. What about scalability? What about future requirements? My answer is usually the same: build for what you know, not what you guess. You can’t predict where the bottlenecks will be at 100x scale—but you can build something clean and understandable today that’ll be easier to adapt tomorrow.

The simplest thing isn’t always the easiest to find. It takes patience, curiosity, and a willingness to look past the first three ideas that come to mind. But when you find it? There’s nothing quite like that feeling. It’s the satisfaction of a problem neatly solved, without any extra moving parts.

So next time you’re staring at a blank whiteboard or a new codebase, take a breath. Ask yourself: what’s the simplest thing that could possibly work here? You might be surprised how far it takes you.
