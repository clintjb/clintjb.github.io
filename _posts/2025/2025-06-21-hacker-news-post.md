_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post.

**Bun’s Next Chapter: Joining Forces with Anthropic**  

Well, here we are. After almost five years of late nights, endless debugging sessions, and more than a few “this should *not* be working” moments, Bun is taking a big leap forward. I’ll cut to the chase: **Bun is now part of Anthropic**.  

This isn’t one of those “startup gets acquired, everything changes” stories. Let me be crystal clear: Bun stays Bun. It’s still open-source, MIT-licensed, and built in public by the same slightly sleep-deprived team (hi, it’s me). We’re not going anywhere. If anything, we’re doubling down on what makes Bun *Bun*: speed, simplicity, and that relentless itch to make JavaScript tooling *better*.  

### How We Got Here  
Rewind to 2021. I was knee-deep in a browser-based voxel game project, frustrated that every tiny code change meant waiting *45 seconds* for a Next.js dev server reload. Sound familiar? So, like any rational person, I got *distracted*. Three weeks later, I’d ported esbuild’s JSX/TypeScript transpiler to Zig. A tweet, some viral chaos, and suddenly we had a GitHub repo with 20k stars in a week.  

Life got weird. We raised a seed round, rented an office the size of a closet (with desks!), and somehow convinced brilliant engineers to join this rollercoaster. Fast-forward through Bun v1.0, Windows support (yes, *finally*), Node.js compatibility wars, and a growing list of production users—from startups to even Midjourney and X.  

But the real plot twist? **AI coding tools**. Late last year, something shifted. Tools like Claude Code stopped being neat demos and started *actually* helping developers. And guess what they were using under the hood? Bun’s single-file executables—self-contained, fast-starting binaries perfect for distributing AI-powered CLIs. The more I used Claude Code myself, the more obsessed I got.  

### Why Anthropic?  
Let’s address the elephant in the room: *But Jarred, Bun had runway! You didn’t* need *to do this!*  

True. We had years to figure out monetization. But here’s the thing: **the world changed**. AI isn’t just automating code—it’s reshaping *how* code gets written, tested, and deployed. If the future is AI agents cranking out code at lightspeed, the runtime they run on *matters*. It has to be fast. Predictable. Bulletproof.  

Anthropic gets this. They’re betting on Bun as the engine for Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, and their future AI coding products. That means Bun isn’t just surviving—it’s *central* to a seismic shift in development. And for us? It means no more existential spreadsheet gymnastics about “how do we monetize a runtime?” Instead, we get to focus purely on building—with Anthropic’s resources, long-term stability, and a front-row seat to where AI coding is headed.  

### What Changes (and What Doesn’t)  
Let’s break it down:  

- **Bun stays Bun**: Still MIT-licensed. Still built in public on GitHub. Still me, Oven, and the team pushing daily commits.  
- **We’re shipping faster**: Anthropic’s backing means more firepower (yes, we’re hiring!), deeper integration with AI tooling, and fewer distractions.  
- **Closer to the future**: Working alongside Claude Code’s team means Bun evolves *with* AI’s needs, not guessing from the sidelines.  

And for you—developers, teams, companies betting on Bun—**nothing breaks**. Your stack, your workflows, your trust in Bun’s roadmap? All intact. If anything, this move *guarantees* Bun’s here for the long haul.  

### Looking Ahead  
This is wild to say, but Bun’s story is just getting started. We’ve got big plans:  
- Making Bun *the* runtime for AI-generated code—fast, reliable, and lightweight enough for agents.  
- Deeper Node.js compatibility (yes, we hear you).  
- Expanding Bun’s toolkit for modern dev—think better frontend workflows, tighter database integrations, and yes, even more speed.  

And to everyone who’s downloaded Bun, filed an issue, or tweeted a hot take: **thank you**. You turned a side project into something that powers millions of projects. I’m still that same developer, annoyed by slow tooling, obsessing over startup times. Only now, we’ve got a rocket strapped to that obsession.  

So, pour a drink (whisky, coffee, whatever fuels you), keep building, and stay tuned. The best is yet to come.
