# My Love Affair with Vintage Typewriters (and Why I Can’t Stop Fixing Them)

There’s something hypnotic about the *clack* of a typewriter key striking paper. Not the soft tap of a mechanical keyboard, not the digital silence of an iPad—no, the real deal. A weighted, analog *thunk* that leaves ink on the page like a signature.  

I didn’t set out to become a typewriter hoarder. It started innocently enough: a rusty 1967 Olympia SM9 at a flea market in Berlin, priced at what felt like criminal theft. "Just for decoration," I told myself. A week later, I was elbow-deep in mineral spirits, cleaning century-old grease off typebars, and I was hooked.  

### The Allure of Broken Things  
Most people see a jammed carriage or a missing ribbon spool and think, *junk*. I see a puzzle. A mechanical haiku. A stubborn old machine that just needs the right nudge—and maybe a new spring from a Soviet-era parts bin.  

Take the Olivetti Lettera 32, for example. A gorgeous, avocado-green portable from the ’70s. I found one in a dusty antique shop with half the keys stuck and a drawband so frayed it looked like overcooked spaghetti. Three hours (and one coffee-fueled tantrum) later, that little beast was typing like it had something urgent to say. That moment—when the first clear imprint of a word forms on fresh paper—is pure, unadulterated joy.  

### The Dark Side of the Hobby  
It’s not all romantic nostalgia. There’s the time I accidentally launched a tiny screw into the abyss of my apartment floorboards (RIP, Royal Quiet De Luxe alignment). Or the eBay seller who swore a 1920s Underwood was "fully functional," only for it to arrive with a carriage held together by hope and duct tape.  

Then there’s the *smell*. Decades of dust, oxidized oil, and sometimes… questionable organic residue. Nothing a can of WD-40 and sheer determination can’t fix, but still—wear gloves.  

### Why Bother?  
In an age where my phone autocorrects *because* to *beeswax*, there’s something rebellious about a machine that demands precision. No undo button. No delete key. Just you, the paper, and the consequences of your spelling errors.  

Plus, there’s magic in the engineering. These weren’t designed for planned obsolescence. They were built to outlast their owners—and many have. A well-maintained typewriter from the 1940s will still outlive the laptop I’m typing this on.  

### The Current Obsession  
Right now, I’m neck-deep in restoring a 1953 Groma Kolibri—a tiny East German clamshell typewriter so compact it fits in a handbag. It’s missing three screws, the platen’s hard as a hockey puck, and the space bar sticks if you look at it wrong. But when it works? Pure poetry.  

(Yes, I *could* buy a new keyboard. But where’s the fun in that?)  

So here’s to the stubborn, the broken, and the beautifully obsolete. May your keys clack, your ribbons stay inked, and your repair bills remain questionable.  

Got a typewriter story (or a spare screwdriver)? Drop me a line. Or better yet, send me your worst eBay misfire. I dare you.
