_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Friday 31 October 2025_



**Affinity Suite Just Went Free. What a Time To Be Creative!**  

Let me tell you—this is one of those moments that makes you want to high-five the universe. Remember back when professional-grade design software meant shelling out *obscene* monthly fees or pirating tools that’d crash mid-project? (*Shudder.*)  

Well, strap in—[Affinity just dropped their entire suite for free](https://www.affinity.studio/get-affinity). No catch. No subscription trap. Just *boom*, creative power unleashed.  

I’ve been tinkering with Affinity apps since Version 1, back when my son was still doodling stick figures and I was convincing my team that no, *Photoshop isn’t the only way to live*. What hooked me wasn’t just the price (though the one-time fee felt like daylight robbery in the Adobe era). It was how *fluid* it all felt—like the developers actually understood the chaos of a designer’s workflow. Need to tweak a vector while your laptop’s wheezing through 50 browser tabs? Affinity Designer laughs and asks, “Is that all you got?”  

And Photo? Mate. The nondestructive editing alone is worth throwing confetti for.  

But *free*? That changes everything. Suddenly, the kid learning graphic design in her dorm room, the startup founder DIY-ing their branding, the retired engineer picking up digital art—they all get a seat at the table. No more gatekeeping. No more “creative tools only for those who can bleed monthly fees.”  

I’ve always believed that the best tools disappear into your process—they don’t *become* the process. Affinity gets that. No bloat, no endless upsells, just clean, stupidly fast software that gets out of your way.  

So here’s my hot take: this move isn’t just generous. It’s *revolutionary*. It’s the creative equivalent of handing out rocket boosters.  

*(Quick sidenote: if your browser’s older than my BBQ smoker, [update it](https://www.affinity.studio/get-affinity). Trust me, you’ll wanna see this beauty in full glory.)*  

What I love most though? The *audacity* of it. In a world obsessed with subscriptions and data harvesting, Affinity’s out here whispering, “Nah, just make cool stuff.”  

So go grab it. Build that portfolio. Design that indie game logo. Mock up your dream coffee shop’s menu. And when you do, shoot me a note—I’ll raise a whisky to your chaos.  

*Here’s to fewer barriers, more creating.* 🥃
