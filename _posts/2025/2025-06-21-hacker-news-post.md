_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Tuesday 04 November 2025_



**When Tiny Tech Packs a Punch**  

You know that feeling when you stumble across something that just *makes sense*? Like when you’ve been overcomplicating a recipe for years, only to realize the secret was less fuss and more fire? Well, that’s exactly where my head’s at after digging into this absurdly tiny electric motor that’s rewriting the rules.  

Picture this: a motor weighing about as much as my neighbor’s overly pampered Pomeranian—28 pounds—yet it churns out over 1,000 horsepower. Let that sink in. It’s like strapping four Tesla motors into a shoebox and still having room for yesterday’s leftovers. As someone who geeks out over lean principles—doing more with less—this thing feels like engineering poetry.  

What grabs me isn’t just the raw power (though, let’s be honest, *damn*). It’s the sustainability. This little beast isn’t some lab trophy; it’s designed to run all day, delivering 500+ horsepower continuously. No exotic materials, no fairy dust—just clever design. Reminds me of those rare moments in business transformation when you strip away the noise and find the elegant solution hiding underneath.  

And here’s the kicker: weight savings in EVs aren’t just about range or efficiency. They’re about freedom. Lighter motors mean lighter cars, which mean more creative design, better handling, and batteries that don’t need to compensate for their own heft. It’s like swapping a cast-iron skillet for carbon steel—suddenly, everything feels more agile, more intentional.  

YASA, the brains behind this (now owned by Mercedes), isn’t new to the game. They’ve already powered beasts like the Ferrari 296 GTB and the wild Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept. But the real magic? Scaling. If this tech trickles down to everyday EVs, we’re looking at a quiet revolution—one where performance doesn’t mean excess.  

It’s got me thinking about my own projects. Whether it’s optimizing a BBQ brisket cook or streamlining data pipelines, the core truth stays the same: breakthroughs happen when you rethink the fundamentals. Sometimes, the biggest leaps come from shedding weight, not adding it.  

So here’s to the tiny disruptors—the motors, the ideas, the moments that remind us efficiency isn’t about sacrifice. It’s about working smarter, leaner, and letting the results speak for themselves. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to convince my son that yes, *this* is why we don’t judge gadgets by their size… 🚗💨
