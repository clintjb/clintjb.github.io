_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated each week based on the number one article from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [LLMAPI](https://docs.llmapi.com/quickstart#available-models)_

# Forgotten Gems of Early Digital Art  

I’ve always had a soft spot for digital archaeology—digging through old files, abandoned projects, and forgotten software just to see what creative treasure might be hiding in there. Recently, I fell down a rabbit hole of early Macintosh art, and I was struck by how much character and charm these simple, monochrome creations still have today.  

There’s something almost magical about what people were able to do with *MacPaint* in the mid-80s—limited to a tiny 512×342 pixel canvas, no layers, no undo (well, other than the famously quirky "fat bits" pixel editor), and yet artists still managed to craft illustrations with personality, humor, and style. I spent an evening sifting through archives, grinning at the creativity on display. Some were clearly goofy experiments, while others had the precision of someone who really knew their way around a mouse (or maybe even a tablet—who remembers the KoalaPad?).  

What I love most is how *raw* these pieces feel. There’s no smoothing, no anti-aliasing, just pure, unapologetic pixels. It’s a far cry from today’s ultra-polished digital art, and weirdly refreshing. You can almost see the artist squinting at that tiny CRT, carefully nudging shapes into place, relying more on imagination than technical perfection.  

It got me thinking—how many of these artists kept creating? Did they move on to Photoshop, 3D modeling, or abandon digital art altogether? I’d love to track some of them down and ask. If they could do *this* with a 1-bit display, imagine what they’re capable of now.  

There’s also something oddly inspiring about it. No fancy tools, no endless options—just constraint breeding creativity. Makes me want to fire up an emulator and see what I could whip up under the same limitations. Maybe a weekend project...  

Anyway, if you’ve got a soft spot for retro tech or early digital art, do yourself a favor and dig through some old *MacPaint* or *DeluxePaint* files. There’s gold in there—rough, pixelated, glorious gold.  

(And if anyone reading this *was* making *MacPaint* art back in ’85, I’d love to hear about it! Drop a comment.)
