_⚠️ **THIS POST IS GENERATED WITH LLMs**: This post is newly generated a few times a week based on trending articles from hacker news. It takes the tone of my writing style, takes the topic from Hacker News - throws in some LLM magic and generates this post. Please be aware I don't read what gets generated here - it means I may agree, I may not - its a crap shoot - its not meant to be an opinion piece but merely [an experiment](https://github.com/clintjb/Weekly-Post) with the services from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - last updated Sunday 16 November 2025_


**The Web’s Shadowy Corners: When Pressure Campaigns Hit Close to Home**  

There’s something uniquely unsettling about watching an obscure clash unfold in real time — especially when it knocks on your door. A few weeks back, an email landed in our inbox from an organization I’d never heard of: the *Web Abuse Association Defense*. French. Official-sounding. Demanding we block **archive.today** across AdGuard DNS. Their reasoning? Alleged refusal to remove illegal content.  

My first reaction? A mix of skepticism and curiosity. We’re a DNS service — not content moderators or hosting police. It’s like asking a plumber to fix a traffic jam. But threats have a way of sharpening your focus.  

Legal advice came next. Turns out, French law (Article 6-I-7 of the LCEN) *could* force our hand. The idea that a private company might have to act as judge and jury on content legality? **Flawed.** These decisions belong in courts, not inboxes.  

But here’s where it got spicy: we reached out to Archive.today themselves. To their credit, they replied fast. The content in question? Gone within hours. And their side of the story? They’d **never** received prior notices about those URLs. Instead, they hinted at a pattern — a wave of “serial complaints” from French entities, all designed to pressure intermediaries like us into cutting off their service.  

Curiosity turned into full-blown detective mode.  

***Who*** *was this “Web Abuse Association Defense”?*  

Their website name-dropped Europol, OFAC, NCA — heavy hitters. But evidence of collaboration? Ghosts. The association itself was registered only months earlier, in early 2025. Their address? A generic mass-registration spot in France. Their Twitter? Four followers, a handful of reposts. *Thin.*  

Then came the “evidence”: bailiff reports (or *constat d’huissier*). Most ordered in August 2025 — not 2023, as WAAD claimed. Only two were older, from 2023. And here’s the kicker: those weren’t ordered by WAAD at all. The name on them matched someone Archive.today’s admin had tangled with before — a lawyer whose domain was suspiciously registered *the same day* a prior complaint was sent. Redirects, dead links, ProtonMail addresses. The digital equivalent of smoke and mirrors.  

We’re now filing a complaint with French police. False reports under LCEN carry real penalties — up to €15,000 and a year in jail. Someone’s playing a dangerous game.  

But the bigger picture? It’s messy. Archive.today’s value is undeniable — preserving the web’s ephemeral moments — but its shadows attract trouble. And intermediaries like us? We’re caught in the crossfire.  

For now, two truths stand out:  
- Pressure campaigns thrive on opacity.  
- The loudest accusations don’t always wear the whitest hats.  

As for WAAD? Still a ghost. Cloudflare shields their site. Name.com hides their domain history. ProtonMail seals their emails. A perfect faceless operation.  

**So — what’s next?**  

We keep pushing. Transparency matters. Accountability matters. And while the FBI’s rumored involvement adds another layer (CSAM investigations are no joke), our role stays clear: protect users, question motives, and resist arm-twisting from faceless entities.  

This isn’t just about DNS blocks or French law. It’s about who gets to shape the web’s boundaries — and how easily those lines can be weaponized.  

Grab a drink, folks. The internet’s getting *weird* again.
