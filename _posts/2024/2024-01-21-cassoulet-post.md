Having spent a lot of time in Toulouse, one of the things to have left a lasting impression on me is the food - genuinely one of my favorite winter dishes is this French classic and cooked at least every January here in the Bird household.

* 800g can crushed tomatoes
* 1 large can white beans (~600g)
* 200g thick bacon cut into 1 inch pieces
* 5 fresh sausages cut into thirds (~300g)
* 1 duck leg confit and pulled ([recipe here](https://clintbird.com/blog/duck-confit-post))
* 1 medium onion
* 3 garlic cloves (minced)
* 500ml chicken stock
* 200ml wine
* 2 sprigs rosemary
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon thyme
* 1 1/2 cups coarse breadcrumbs

In a large dutch oven over medium heat, cook the bacon for 3 to 4 minutes stirring frequently, until it renders much of its fat but is not yet crisp. Transfer the bacon to a large plate and brown the sausages on all sides and let sit with the bacon.

Add the onions and garlic to the pan and allow to brown in the oil - once done, add all ingredients (and a healthy dose of the duck fat / oil from the confit), stir and bring to a simmer. Add to a 150Â° preheated oven with the lid off and allow it to cook for ~1.5 hours.

In the last 10 minutes or so spread the breadcrumbs over the top and allow them to toast before being served with fresh bread - bon appetit!
