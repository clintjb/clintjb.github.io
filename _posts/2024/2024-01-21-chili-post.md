There are a million versions of this recipe out there, but this is mine that's always a hit with everyone in the family (not an easy achievement!) The "over the top" method basically means the meat is cooked for the first half of the cook sitting directly over the chili - the advantage of this is that the meat has a different texture and flavor when it is eventually added to the chili - for me it really makes an enormous difference.

Chili Base
* 500g minced beef
* 3 garlic cloves (minced)
* 2 medium onions
* 1 red capsicum
* 800g can crushed tomatoes
* 400g can red kidney beans (drained)
* 3 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 beef cubes (crumbled)
* 1 bottle of dark beer

Chili Spice
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked chipotle
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 4 teaspoons ancho / Mexican chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons onion or garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons oregano
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar

This can either be cooked in the oven or smoker - get either up to a temperature of 100ยบ. Next dice all the vegetables and, add 1 tbsp olive oil to a cast iron Dutch oven and allow it to heat up. Add the diced vegetables and a little of your favorite rub and allow the vegetables to brown and soften.

While doing this season the mince liberally with your favorite rub and roll it into a large ball - here sit the meat on a metal cooling rack and place it over the Dutch oven (you'll get a nice finish on the meat while the fat drips into the vegetables themselves) allow it to cook for an hour or so.

After 1 hour, add the dry ingredients, the tomatoes, beer, beans and tomato paste. Stir and place the meat back over the Dutch oven. Let it continue to cook until the meat has reached an internal temp of ~60ยบ.

Begin to crumble/break the meat up and place meat it directly in the chili. Let it cook until a total of 3.5-4 hours of cooking time is reached. Serve it up with some fresh bread, grated cheese, and sour creme!
Cheers
