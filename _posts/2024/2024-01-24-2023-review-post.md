This is now the fourth year in a row ([last years here](https://clintbird.com/blog/2022-review-post)) where I've been using the end of the year as an opportunity (to firstly go for a Gluhwein!) but to also reflect with the teams on the success and learning's from that year - being part of an international team means its always difficult to have us all together physically so the easier alternative is creating a small presentation to share on what we achieved this year and where we head for the next.

One of my own personal Christmas traditions now is to throw this together with a whisky while watching football, so for that reason, it's a bit quick and dirty and not exactly optimized for all screens (aka use your laptop / monitor!)
