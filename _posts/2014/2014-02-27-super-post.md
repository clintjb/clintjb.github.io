For those that don't know me so well, I'm a huge comics fan. This is a series entitled "Super" created by a very talented artist named [Mike Mitchell](http://www.sirmikeofmitchell.com/index.php?/super/) - anyway itâ€™s a series of pop culture characters based on the styling and pose from the first appearance of Superman.

Fantastic Stuff!
