Not quite - missed the mark here...<br><br>Was always a bit of a patchwork solution but we paused this quickly - stole the lessons learned, pivoted and is now whats driven us to the API first approach!</p>

                        <p class="preview__item-description">Airflow at the end of the day never probably should've been with us, but it was born out the need to professionalize what we do (we cant run python scripts on peoples PCs indefinitely!) With Airflow came the need to host it somewhere, and bought about our journey into Airbus DevOps & the OpenShift platform. Crazy to think how much new ground in Airbus we broke with this <i>(non IT DevOps team / external net / SAP connectors for Airflow etc)</i><br><br>Between FreshDesk, API First and just general pipelines - we're expecting Airflow to deliver big things & make its mark in 2022. An amazing project really throwing us into the world of DevOps and modern platforms!</p>

                        <p class="preview__item-description">My view is this year we really transitioned from the "storming" to "norming" phase from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development" target="_blank">Tuckman</a> model as an organization - clearly next year will be that final transition into the performing phase. It means further refinement, polish and stabilization of what we've been creating <i>(so an evolution not a revolution)</i> - you should all be proud, coming to this phase simply shows we've been successful as a team.<br><br>For 2022 though, our <i>"customer"</i> base is changing. This year it was the advanced analysts, data engineers setting the baselines. Next year it will be all about the business using the data, as the basics are now in place. We need to ensure we go the extra mile and bring our customers on board to get value from what we've built - <i>a satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all.</i></p>

Crazy to think but at the start of the year we only had a few datasets limited to weekly updates only. Based on this, it led to an enormous series of activities that needed to be developed such as delta loading procedures / field encryptions / FTP implementation / ingestion libraries for front & backend. An absolute monumental level of work done by many parties to get us to where we are today.<br><br>This really was a bit of a definition of the year and the absolute baseline to build 2022 on!</p>

                        <p class="preview__item-description">Im not sure anyone can truly appreciate the efforts and energy Chee Chuan went through this year when it came to preparing for presentations <i>(DITL / Leadership Team Awareness / Bruno & Co / Customer Roadshow etc)</i><br><br>Each and every session went in with an open mind, refined his style, pacing, delivery - each time noticeably better than the last. The evolution he made this year was nothing short of amazing. This kind of dedication & vulnerability to put yourself so far out your comfort zone and deliver anyway should be an inspiration to all of us!</p>

Dirks simple summary - <i>"planning policies should at least include part dimensions as it drives the replenishment costs & lead-times"</i><br><br>💥BOOM - 40m€ per year opportunities listed at PN level without breaking a sweat!</p>

We talk about diversity in teams, Luis was the <i>academic</i> diversity - he bought his views and challenged all of us to be better in his own way. Few of us learnt more about supplychain theory in a year with Luis than what others would learn in a lifetime in planning.<br><br>His time with us <i>(as well as that dammed tearjerker of a goodbye presentation!)</i> will always hold a special spot.</p>
