For 20+ years, I’ve been honing my skills as a transformation and business leader, adept at navigating the intersection between operational excellence and digital innovation. 

My expertise spans operations, digital transformation, project delivery, and organizational change management. This experience has been developed in increasingly responsible leadership positions across automotive, aerospace, and military sectors.

Too often, strategies fall short in execution because the gap between high level vision and operational reality is never truly closed. I enjoy nothing more than bringing clever, pragmatic solutions to life to solve these complex challenges.

I’m passionate about applying lean culture and principles to processes, transformation initiatives, and digital technologies - with a focus on understanding the real drivers and impacts at the operational level.

I take pride in developing teams with strong identities and an entrepreneurial mindset, and nothing is more rewarding than seeing people empowered to think creatively, pursue continuous improvement, and focus on what they do best: delivering value through meaningful change and operational excellence.

I’ve also completed a comprehensive Business Administration Program (MBA equivalent) developed entirely out of MOOCs from some of the worlds top business programmes. You can find my curriculum & transcript [here](/mba/)
