As someone who has dedicated their professional life to reducing operational costs, a cost-conscious ethos is deeply ingrained in me. Challenging the 100% solution to find the best 'bang for the buck' is a core part of my role and something I do almost daily.

It was with this mindset that I approached the challenge of pursuing an MBA that would also accommodate my family and travel commitments. While online degree programs and distance learning have existed for years, the recent surge in online course popularity and availability led me to explore the feasibility of building an MBA entirely from MOOCs offered by some of the world's top business programs.

After researching the curricula of reputable universities like Harvard, Berkeley, Wharton, and Stanford, I identified the following core curriculum:

* Accounting
* Business Strategy
* Economics
* Finance
* Marketing
* Leadership
* Operations
* Statistics / Data Analysis
* Ethics
* Entrepreneurship

Most resources suggested dedicating 8-12 hours per week per subject. As a father of two with a demanding job, I decided to treat this as a long-term goal, tackling one subject at a time. My commute offered a perfect opportunity, allowing me to allocate an hour per workday to study on my tablet during transit.

All told, it was a 2.5-year effort. However, the flexibility this approach provided allowed me to manage it effectively within my schedule. The quality of the courses was phenomenal, and I highly recommend this path to anyone considering it. If you have questions or would like to learn more about my experience, please feel free to reach out.
